Optimizations we did:
======================

You should describe there the optimizations that you
implemented and any special cases that your implementation may not handle.

We optimized constant propagation, where we replaced every variable which is equal an primitive-type with the actual
primitive-type.
We pre-calculated constant expressions.
 - Equations with only plus and minus are simplified. Constants that are known are put together to reduce the amount of
   operators used in the calculation. An expression like (a + (1 + ( (4 - 5) + 3))) simplifies to (a + 3).
 - A special case we did not manage to optimize is that not every constant binary expression is concatenated.
   For example division by zero.
After all those optimizations, we removed the unused variables.
We optimized if-else and while statements with the fork-optimizer, where we check, if the condition is true or false
and delete one branch completely (Transform the condition block to a non-condition block with only one successor).

In the end we tried to replace reoccurring expressions with a temporary variable. But it failed and we had not the time
to debug it.
