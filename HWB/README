Optimizations we did:
======================

You should describe there the optimizations that you
implemented and any special cases that your implementation may not handle.

We optimized constant propagation, where we replaced every variable which is equal an primitive-type with the actual
primitive-type.
We pre-calculated constant expressions.
 - Equations with only plus and minus are simplified. Constants that are known are put together to reduce the amount of
   operators used in the calculation. An expression like (a + (1 + ( (4 - 5) + 3))) simplifies to (a + 3).
 - A special case we did not manage to optimize is that not every constant binary expression is concatenated.
   For example if a division by zero occurs in an expression, the whole expression is not optimized.
After all those optimizations, we removed the unused variables.
We optimized if-else and while statements with the fork-optimizer, where we check, if the condition is true or false
and delete one branch completely (Transform the condition block to a non-condition block with only one successor).

In the end we tried to replace reoccurring expressions with a temporary variable. But it failed and we had not the time
to debug it.

==============================
Assembly Optimizations we did:
==============================

We removed unnecessary nullpointer checks when we knew that a variable is definitely not null. We keep track if a
variable is not null and reset that every time the variable is assigned, except we know that the value assigned to the
variable is not null.

Next we removed unnecessary ArrayBoundsCheck. When we access a location in an array and it succeeds, we know that from
0 to that index all accesses are safe. Also if we know the size of the array at compile time we already know which
locations are safe.

We also tried to remove loads from constants into registers for binaryOps and array creations. We managed to do this for
commutative operations but non-commutative operations are giving us some trouble...

We started working on reusing register. If we know that we saved variable "a" to register, let's say, EDI we can just use
that register instead of loading variable "a" again from the stack. But this leads to numbers of problems. We have to
make sure that every time we modify that register we do not reuse that register for "a" anymore. Also in a binary
operation when we want reuse the register on the left side for a variable but we modify it on the right side with an
operation the left side won't be allowed to reuse that register anymore.
