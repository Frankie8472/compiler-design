Review EpicXi

StmtGen:
Line 56 Strings in DATA_INT_SECTION, bad
Line 94 use intern method emitConstantData("0")
Line 126 & 140 used more stack than needed

ExprGen: 
Line 87 unneccesary if you swap r1 and r2 in Line 108 and replace 112 and 115 with the counterpart (r1->r2 and r2->r1)

AstCodeGenerator:
Before doing something, registers are initialized! good!
========================================
Review divide_by_zero

ToDoException:
wrong place for public static boolean test = false

AssemblyEmitter:
deleted emitMove(Register, String), why?

AstCodeGenerator:
emitted prologue in constructor, not the right place

RegisterCounter:
implemented a visitor for counter purpose, good!

StmtGen:
Line 103 parser is testing this
Line 117 ugly code, but a register saved...
Line 122 unneccessary
Line 137 should be 8 not 4

ExprGen:
Line 38 varset static, bad! (parallel multiple trees, all have the same, bad) and write small (java convention, is no class)
Line 82 instead of first and second, left and right would have helped I with the binary ops
Line 105 what about an excpetion?
Line 108 faulty implementation of minus, it is not always dest(right) - src(left)
Line 154 just use move
========================================
Review basic

StmtGen:
Line 26 import static -> import, for joshi reasons
Line 61 I like java doc
Line 85,86 destroing bytes

ExprGen:
Line 65, 69 no accept, call visit! And you did not chekc which tree to traverse first!
Line 66, 72 why push pop
Line 74 use given enums, if changes made to string, you should not have to change multiple files ideally
