AstCodeGenerator
 + emitSuffix adds some useful functions to the binary like error codes and methods for true or false.
 o Puts vTable on the stack, why not heap?
 - emitSuffix could have had more explanation than "some helper functions".
 
StmtGenerator
 + Switching on lhs kind in assign node, and checking for errors.
 + Stack Frame conveniently explained in a comment.
 - Unfortunately this is pretty much the only comment.

ExprGenerator
 + Everything seems to be properly implemented.
 o Very verbose BinOp implementation of boolean expressions.
 - No selfmade comments.
 
VTable, VTableCreator
 + VTable itself is a compact solution for the vTable problem.
 - Barely any comments.
 
Code style pet peeve
 o Minimal use of space character, e.g. for(int i=0;i<RegisterManager.CALLER_SAVE.length;i++)
