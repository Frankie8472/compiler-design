Code Review - ATeam

General:
+ nice use of labels
- very few comments

AstCodeGenerator:
+ nice solution to use labels for exit codes and subtype checking
+ good setup of vtables

StmtGenerator:
• AssemblyEmitter has already a method to get a unique label, but your version is more readable
- sometimes your statements are a little complex

ExprGenerator:
• binaryOp():
    - could have handled B_DIV and B_MOD in the same switch case
    - no zero check in B_MOD
    - lot of redundant code in comparison operations
• are objects stored directly in array instead of pointers to objects?
