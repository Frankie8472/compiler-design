General: 
-No or very few comments - not always clear, what the idea of each part is
-The comments for the layouts are nice.
LabelUtil:
-A good way of keeping an overview, and is easy to understand
VTable:
-You are adding all methods (from parents and current class) to the VTable od each class - what happens with the overwritten methods? Not clear how you handle this case
ExprGenerator:
-newArray()/newObject() - nice to see the array/object layout in memory 
AstCodeGenerator:
-You are printing the VTables very systematically. Makes it clean
