CurrentContext:
	+ Nice way to implement it using a hashmap.
	+ Well documented, clear comments.
	- A overview of the stack layout would help to understand where the specific values go.

LabelUtil:
	+ Good to put it in a separate class. This makes the code cleaner.
	- Special label for the main method is not generated in this class even though we have the current context which indicates if we are in the main method or not.

VTable:
	- Almost no comments. Here some comments would be helpful.

ExprGenerator:
	- Not clear what "call cast" refers to. A comment would help.
	- The same holds for the checks. Where are they defined?
	- In binaryOp having the entire code in the case statements makes them less clean. Instead setting some labels there and emitting the code afterwards would be a better idea.

StmtGenerator:
	- In methodDecl the label is emitted twice. I don't think this is necessary.
