VTable/VTableVisitor:
	+ Overridden methods have the same offset.
	- The comments don't help much for understanding the code. (At least not for someone who didn't write it)

AddressExprGenerator:
	+ Check for nullpointers and valid array bounds.
	- In index I'm not sure if backing up all those registers is really necessary.

AstCodeGenerator:
	+ Added some useful methods.
	- These methods probably would fit better in the AssemblyEmitter class than in the AstCodeGenerator.

StmtGenerator:
	- In methodDecl if we are in the main method then we need to have a Main object created at some point. Where does that happen?

ExprGenerator:
	- In binaryOp a lot of code is emitted in the case statements (comparative operators). Instead you could have set the value of a string there that holds the operation that is needed in the specific case and then you only had to emit the entire code once.
	+ Valid cast check implemented. However a few comments would have been nice there.
