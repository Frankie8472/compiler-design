AddressExprGenerator.java
  - naming of savedReg1, savedReg2 ... makes it a bit confusing, why not savedRegEAX? would be clearer
  + interesting idea to implement this part of the assignment in a seperate class

AstCodeGenerator.java
  + good idea to implement emitDebug methods

Overall
  - only very little comments
  - lots of duplicated code in AddressExprGenerator and ExprGenerator

VTableVisitor
  - the two for-loops (line 57/58) aren't really readable since they are squeezed onto one line
