Review for JavaLiterates by divide_by_zero

- AssemblyEmitter.java
    + great that all the assembly code (e.g. toFile) is in this class and not in AstCodeGenerator
    + makes everything really clean
    + all the additional methods (e.g. sub, inc, neg) makes the code at other places easier to read

- Overall
    + many and really good comments -> really easy to understand what you did
    + very clean code, a joy to read

- AstCodeGenerator.java
    + clean because assembly code not here

- ExpGenerator.java
    + we really liked the switch(ast.sym.kind) -> easy to understand

- ObjectTables.java
    + interesting solution with HashMap<String, ObjectTable>
    - names ObjectTable and ObjectTables get a bit confusing
    + nice solution with the writtenMethods (also reversing the list at the end)

- Config.java
    . why were the exit-strings changed?
