ObjTables:
	- objSize also counts overridden fields. --> Why?
	- In general the methods in these classes are not self explanatory. A few more comments would have been nice.

StmtGenerator:
	- In assign, why do you call initRegisters() in the end?
	+ Doing a case distinction in the case of a Var using the VariableSymbol's Kind enum in a switch statement a clean way of doing it.
	+ In binaryOp using the added methods from the AssemblyEmitter is a very smart way of keeping the code clean and more readable.
	+ Having the stack layout as a comment in the code is helpful.

AssemblyEmitter:
	+ Adding often used emit methods here makes the entire project more readable.

In general:
	- There are none of the checks implemented.
