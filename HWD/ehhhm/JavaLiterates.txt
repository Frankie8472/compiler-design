AstCodeGenerator
 o Concise but hard to read lambda function style of programming.
 + Good location to emit prologue and bootstrap main function.
 + Includes error codes, and check methods for them.
 - Would have benefitted from more comments.
 
StmtGenerator
 + Elegant solution for passing context through visitor (Tuple).
 + Well commented.
 
ExprGenerator
 + Compact implementation of boolean expressions using set instructions.
 - Some methods could have used more comments, e.g. methodCall.
 
VTable, MemLayout
 + Elegant functional style.
 - Hard to read (And not a single comment).
 
ClassContext, MethodContext
 + Relatively simple solution that works well.
 + Good place to handle the stack, and even aligns to 8 bytes.
