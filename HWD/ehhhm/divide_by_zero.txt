feedback for the group ehhhm - by divide_by_zero

+ neat solution with the Monads / Lambda Expressions (.strean, .map, .filter, .foreach)
  --> decreases size of code
  --> in combination with comments it would be a really nice solution

+ nice idea with parameterNeedsVisitor (in combination with if(save)...)

- practically no comments
  --> espacially for the Monads / Lambda expresssion  / inline functions the code was hard to read / understand
